# Environment Variables On Windows

Cotton is a framework for Pulp-like experiences in Lua. It will allow you to use most of the features Pulp has to offer, but instead of being limited by Pulp, this framework is extendible, has LDtk build-in for easy level editing, and more!

### Requirements.

Make sure the Playdate SDK is already installed before following this tutorial.

### Let's start!
