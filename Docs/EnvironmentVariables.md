# Environment Variables On Windows

Setting up the environment variable on Windows takes a little more time the on other platforms. So I'd thought I'd help you guys out a bit.

## Requirements.

Playdate SDK should be installed.

## Let's start!

1. Search in Windows for the Playdate Simulator & open it's file location.

</p>

3. Copy the "start in" location and keep it somewhere safe for later in the tutorial. This is your "SDK directory"

</p>

7. Type ```PLAYDATE_SDK_PATH``` in the "variable name" field & copy the "SDK directory" from before in the "variable value" field.
Press OK afterwards!

8. Your done! The environment variable for the Playdate SDK should now be configured!
